Superframes

The magic of being a human is that we can slip on mental frames. I've come to think of them as super frames. For a given context 

How do you feel under the influence of:
Of a movie
of a drug
of a deep conversation and connection?
of a  great book
Personally I feel a state change. To this day I physically cannot get up from a movie theater until I sit all the way through the credits so I can settle down. I MUST process whatever just happened. If I don't then it's as if there's information spillover and I get out of sorts. 

I used to think that thought systems are hierarchical. For example science was better than art than basket weaving. I've come to realize that the magic of humanity is in our ability to construct

For example in highschool I would often leave the drawing studio with magical powers. I could collapse trees and the quaker meeting house into a 2 dimensional plane (sometimes peering through fingers), figuring the proportions for later with pencil and paper.

When I was in graduate school I would walk around campus noticing patterns and 

As I've progressed in my career I understand there is no single system. The magic is the ability to flex our abilities. 

I often think about the attitudes I would adopt given a social reality. That's been an influential thought experiment toward breaking any notion of objectivity. It's clear that my thoughts and attitudes exist in a very specific place and time and context. 

What views might you hold if you lost your job and couldn't feed your family? What views might you have held in a different social context? 
Consider for a moment how you would have felt as a poor German suffering under crippling inflation. German unemployment levels prior to World War II were at 30% (at the time of this writing, during the COVID pandemic in the US we're at about 11%). It doesn't take much to convince myself given that dire situation that Hitler might have won my vote too.

The trick is to step back and think about what frame you're actively in. This is an exercise in deep introspection. But there are shortcuts. The best one I've found is to shift senses. For example if I'm in a visual mode I try to focus on smell. If I'm in a kinesthetic state then I focus on visual focus.
