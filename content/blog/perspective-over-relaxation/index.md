I'm by Yosemite. I took the family out here for a vacation before starting a new job next week. I figure it'll be the closest thing to a summer vacation we'll have this year. I was explaining to a friend that it's not about relaxation. This is about taking a step back to gain perspective. 

I scrolled through my Twitter feed today. I saw a white man (seemed like a teenager) get utterly beaten by a pack of wild humans. It was savage and irrational and I'm not linking to it here. I want to unsee this. This group seemed to be in their 20's, they laughed while they took turns kicking and beating him, round robin style. It is haunting to watch. They moved on and the person was just bleeding and a pulp of human on the concrete. 

This stands in contrast to the cold and calculated murders that my family suffered two generations back in the Holocaust. As a Jewish man I feel compelled to write and help people understand the essential knowledge. At least for my own children to know what they are inheriting - good and bad. 

Which is more troubling? Violence stemming from rage, or from premeditation?

We want to believe in progress. That we are woke with technology, political correctness, big ideas gained from others, cotrical control. We sling words like weapons and shields, tools. They matter here - one slip or wrong word can get you in big trouble. But what's under all this? Power dynamics? Systemic racism? 

Demographics matters. This is a popularity contest to a much larger degree than any of us are willing to openly admit. There exists a rift between what we are saying, and how we are acting. I don't see many independent thinkers here. Sorry. I see a coalescing of viewpoints, and a heck of a lot of apologetic whites. Not all whites are bad. I'm sorry. Let's back away from the generalizations. 

Sorry, but the essay is not the medium to extract meaning from this piling rubble. We are in a tic toc world that needs something more. 

In groups we approximate Chimps. What I see is a veneer of meaning extraction atop a giant heap of preprogrammed behavior. This should make us very leary about getting too complicated about the underlying causes and such. It's pack behavior. And we're all finding the pack we can belong to. I can almost see identities forming as water freezing in molds. 
This pack behavior is obvious manifest in a beating. It's more subtle in regards to group identity. I see people blacking out their profile pics as acts of solidarity. 

Queue montage of solidarity movements through history. These trends have played out through time.

I write as a citizen, a father, a human. Beyond that I wade into a distorged funhouse of confusion with increasing likelihood that what I see looking out, or within, may differ from your construction looking at me. It's hard to know what starting points we can agree on. The number of layers we need to peel back to reach bedrock is proportional to the degree of pain. And it seems it needs to be stripped back 

The points of difference are infinite. What is it we can agree on? Do we want to just vent rage or do we want to solve the problem? Those are different.
