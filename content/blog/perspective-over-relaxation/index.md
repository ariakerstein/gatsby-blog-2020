#### Twitter triggers 
I scrolled through my Twitter feed today. I saw a white man (seemed like a teenager) get beaten nearly to death by a pack of wild humans. Pure evil and I'm not linking to it here. I want to unsee this. The aggressor group seemed to be in their 20's, they laughed while they took turns kicking and beating him, round robin style. They seemed to float and beat like moths to a flame, each taking turns when a space opened up; haunting. I suppose if the species swapped and we were talking about wolves v. rabbit we might inclined toward explanations of teamwork and efficacy of the pack to ensure survival. But this was a display of power of groups, regardless the broader social power structure. 
They moved on fast as they came, leaving behind a twisted and bloody pulp of human on concrete. Small groups picking off individuals erase structural power advantages - in the immediate term.  

#### Background vs. foreground
In groups we approximate Chimps. What I see is a veneer of meaning extraction atop a giant heap of preprogrammed behavior. Awareness  are all finding the pack we can belong to then ossify our identities. That no amount of group 'wokeness' or enlightenment (cortex) can overcome our chimp behaviors. In groups we draw upon millions of years of survival programming against ideas acquired within the past years. Our ideas are fragile. The survival programs are robust. 

I can't help but think about how this stands in contrast to the cold and calculated murders that my family suffered two generations back in the Holocaust. As a Jew I feel compelled to write about this. It's my family legacy, for better or worse. What lessons do I take from this? 

In groups we approximate Chimps. What I see is a veneer of meaning extraction atop a giant heap of preprogrammed behavior. We are all finding the pack we can belong to. 
This pack behavior is obvious manifest in a beating. It's more subtle in regards to group identity. I see people blacking out their profile pics as acts of solidarity. I notice anxious conversations among folks "with the power" (e.g., "Karens") as they tip toe across semantic landmines without a good map. There is something beautiful about our ability to group in non-obvious ways

#### Which is more troubling? Violence stemming from rage, or from premeditation?
Rage and emotional violence is animal. Premeditated and sophisticated violence, systemic violence makes use of our cortical facilities. Perhaps, as with higher mathematics motivated by wartime ballistics, our intelligence is indeed meant for violence. It's hard to see otherwise in times like this. Regardless, our two systems (high, low; limbic and cortical; angels and devils, whatever) are easily manipulated by the group dynamic. 

If we believe this then let's ask the next question. How might we nudge our group dynamics into the more positive direction? Protests like this are great for voicing resentments. That's fine and one can argue it's even necessary. But if protests are necessary as group catharsis and message sending, then there is also a requirement for acknowledgment on the other side of the equation. That seems unlikely given the current administration. So what's actually the point? 

Here's a thought experiment. If you're living in the bay area could you ever say that 

As a Jew living in the bay area I need to keep my mouth shut about Israel. There's a cultural relativism here that all cultures are equal. They are not. Believe it or not the values here are not shared everywhere. The aspirational vectors and information processing frames are different. 

I revert sometimes to my childhood tendencies. Amidst chaos I retreated to my room and organized my baseball cards, tended to my fishtank and read books on the bed. I didn't rage against the world. Seemed dumb. Go ahead and sling all you want. 

We want to believe in progress. That we are woke with technology, political correctness, big ideas gained from others, cotrical control. We sling words like weapons and shields, tools. They matter here - one slip or wrong word can get you in big trouble. But what's under all this? Power dynamics? Systemic racism? 

#### Memes
Demographics matters. This is a popularity contest to a much larger degree than any of us are willing to admit. There exists a rift between what we are saying, and how we are acting. I don't see many independent thinkers here. Sorry. I see a coalescing of viewpoints, and a heck of a lot of apologetic whites. 

#### Charwars
The conversation around the social media platforms is not so much about the message as attacking new battlegrounds. This is where the charwars play out. Social media platforms should police mis/disinformation. What's curious in the news I've been reading (WSJ, BBC, NYT) is that folks are attacking FB for not taking down Trump's messages. This is wrong. First, the message is true to the Presidents words (he said it!). Second, it's accurate news. The president did deploy the national guard and in this sense this constitutes signal/information. The conversation I'm reading about pertains to folks not agreeing with the content of the message. Well, this is the president that was elected (that's a separate issue). Back to the main point, the consitution guarantees freedom of speech. Once a social media platform gets into the business of picking sides it's a slippery slope descending into infinite loop of wack-a-mole. This seems pretty clear cut. 

Sorry, but the essay is not the medium to extract meaning from this piling rubble. We are in a tic toc world that needs something more. 

We should not transfer power as with a bank balance. The right thing is not to give away all our money and be poor because someone else deserves it MORE. They deserve equal opportunity, equal access. Apologeticness for having those resources, that access is not going to solve anything. Wake up, yes. Learn and see. Yes. There is no perfect other side. These are infantile fantasies. People make mistakes on all sides. 

In groups we approximate Chimps. What I see is a veneer of meaning extraction atop a giant heap of preprogrammed behavior. This should make us very leary about getting too complicated about the underlying causes and such. It's pack behavior. And we're all finding the pack we can belong to. I can almost see identities forming as water freezing in molds. 
This pack behavior is obvious manifest in a beating. It's more subtle in regards to group identity. I see people blacking out their profile pics as acts of solidarity.

I write as a citizen, a father, a human. Beyond that I wade into a distorged funhouse of confusion with increasing likelihood that what I see looking out, or within, may differ from your construction looking at me. It's hard to know what starting points we can agree on. The number of layers we need to peel back to reach bedrock is proportional to the degree of pain. And it seems it needs to be stripped back 

#### Principles
The points of difference are infinite. What is it we can agree on? Do we want to just vent rage or do we want to solve the problem? Those are different. 

The constitution is our shared principles document [Constitution](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_States_of_America_1992). Perhaps someone should enact this as a tic toc video. 

I'm by Yosemite. I took the family out here for a vacation before starting a new job next week. I figure it'll be the closest thing to a summer vacation we'll have this year. I was explaining to a friend that it's not about relaxation. This is about taking a step back to gain perspective.
