Sometimes it feels like I'm doing someone else's work. Strangely, this tends to happen on Mondays. I zoom upward to orbit and watch my tiny self operating on the ground. A human pixel. 
Then I ask myself: why do I feel this way? Usually the answers are some combination of overwhelm and insecurity/imposter syndrome.

When I feel this way I'll remind myself that my real aspiration is to do G-d's work. What is the work that makes me feel that burning feeling? Could I feel that way about what I'm working on? What makes me feel G-d's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LCN53q9Y"> pleasure?
