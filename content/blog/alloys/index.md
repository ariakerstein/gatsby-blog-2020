TL;DR - 
* humor => confidence
* a little bit of anger consumes anxiety 

I learned early on that anger doesn't help a situation. This was an early coping mechanism for a hard family life. I figured all that anger was wasted energy so I went inside - to books, ideas, building stuff. That always fit better and helped me not feel deep anger. So I felt better. 

Fast forward a few decades and now as a team leader responsible for the work of many people I can't just withdraw to ethereal flow states to cope. There's lots of opportunity for agitation - from above, from within the team, from within me. So I need to deal with it head on. 

What's the right mental architecture to support such a load? What would be the right alloy to use on the structural beams? 

I only recently realized I've been asking these kinds of questions since I was in high school. On the bus rides to away games I would sit staring out the window, watching the pastoral scenes whizzing past as we traveled to fancy Academies like Exeter, Andover. I would always get so nervous before these games. I had to figure out how to psych myself up. Specifically I needed a way to overcome my paralyzing nerves. 

The wholle thing was so meta - the central conscience convincing itself to be/feel differently about a situation. That game was always really interesting. As I reflect on it I feel like I'm trying to rewrite the long-gone source code on a program that's been running a long time. 

I recall specific experiments I would run on myself - thinking whether humor was better than anger. 
Humor: "I got this" I would try on a frame of humor going into the game vs. a frame of "these people want to murder you and your family".
